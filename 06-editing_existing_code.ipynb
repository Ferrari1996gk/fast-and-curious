    "\n",
    "Properly documenting and commenting code is important for making it understandable and maintainable, particularly if you're collaborating with others, or intend to share your code publicly. It's often a task that programmers choose to put off as it can be time-consuming and tedious. Copilot can help with this by generating comments for you, based on the code you've written.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to do this is to highlight a section of code, then press `Ctrl + I`, then type in ```/doc``` to ask Copilot to generate docstrings for any functions in your code. You may have to do this one function at a time, You can also write a command like \"comment this\" to ask Copilot to generate comments for the selected code. You can also type the comment character (```#``` in Python) where you want a comment to be, then use the autocomplete suggestions to generate a comment."
